# Introduction to Python and R

Code and notes for SEC-190, an introductory coding course that I'm teaching to BSc Physics students at SRM-AP. Code examples are adapted from [Google's Tutorial on Python](https://developers.google.com/edu/python); "Machine Learning using Python" by M Pradhan and U Dinesh Kumar, Wiley Publishers (2019); and ChatGPT (few boilerplate code).
