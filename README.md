# Introduction to Python and R

Code and notes for SEC-190, an introductory coding course that I'm teaching to BSc Physics (Hons.) students at SRM University-AP. 

Disclaimer: While writing and organizing these course material, I took help (adapted code examples) from:
- [Google's Tutorial on Python](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)
- "Machine Learning using Python" by M Pradhan and U Dinesh Kumar, Wiley Publishers (2019)
- Google Gemini  and ChatGPT
